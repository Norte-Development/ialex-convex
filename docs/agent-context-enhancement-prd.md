# Legal Assistant Agent Context Enhancement PRD

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Product**: Legal Assistant Agent Context Enhancement  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Owner**: Development Team  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase

### Problem Statement
The current legal assistant agent operates with minimal context awareness, limiting its effectiveness in providing relevant, case-specific guidance. Users must repeatedly provide background information, and the agent cannot leverage the rich contextual data available within the legal case management system.

### Solution Overview
Implement a hybrid context management system inspired by Cursor AI's approach, combining automatic context gathering, manual context specification, and persistent legal knowledge to create an intelligent, context-aware legal assistant.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Changes

#### New Tables

```sql
-- User presence and activity tracking
presence: {
  userId: Id<"users">,
  caseId: Id<"cases">,
  currentPage: string,
  currentView: string,
  selectedItems: array<string>,
  cursorPosition: optional<number>,
  lastUpdateAt: number
}

-- Activity logging for context
activityLog: {
  userId: Id<"users">,
  caseId: optional<Id<"cases">>,
  action: string,
  entityType: string,
  entityId: string,
  metadata: object,
  timestamp: number
}

-- Firm and personal rules
contextRules: {
  name: string,
  description: string,
  ruleType: "firm" | "personal",
  scope: "global" | "case" | "document",
  conditions: object,
  actions: object,
  createdBy: Id<"users">,
  isActive: boolean
}
```

interface ContextBundle {
  user: UserContext;
  case: CaseContext;
  clients: ClientContext[];
  currentView: ViewContext;
  recentActivity: ActivityContext[];
  manualRefs: ManualContext[];
  rules: RuleContext[];
}

interface ContextService {
  gatherAutoContext(userId: string, caseId: string): Promise<ContextBundle>;
  resolveManualRefs(refs: string[]): Promise<ManualContext[]>;
  applyRules(context: ContextBundle): Promise<ContextBundle>;
  optimizeForTokens(context: ContextBundle, maxTokens: number): ContextBundle;
}
```
