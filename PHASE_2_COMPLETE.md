# ✅ Phase 2 Migration - Implementation Complete

## 📦 What Was Delivered

Phase 2 of the Kinde to Clerk migration has been successfully implemented. All code is ready for deployment and testing.

### Backend Functions (Convex)

All Phase 2 migration functions are located in `apps/application/convex/migrations/`:

#### Core Types and Constants
- ✅ **types.ts** - Flat TypeScript interfaces for all Phase 2 data structures
- ✅ **constants.ts** - Phase 2 configuration constants added

#### Data Fetching Functions (Firestore)
- ✅ **firestoreDataHelpers.ts** - Fetch user data from Firestore
  - `getUserCases(kindeUserId)` - Get all cases for a Kinde user
  - `getUserClients(kindeUserId)` - Get all clients for a Kinde user
  - `getUserDocuments(kindeUserId)` - Get all documents for a Kinde user

#### File Migration Functions
- ✅ **fileStorageHelpers.ts** - Handle file migration from Firebase to GCS
  - `uploadFileToGCS(firebaseUrl, fileName, mimeType)` - Download from Firebase, upload to GCS

#### Document Processing Integration
- ✅ **processingHelpers.ts** - Trigger document processor service
  - `triggerDocumentProcessing(documentId, gcsBucket, gcsObject)` - Initiate document processing workflow

#### Entity Migration Functions
- ✅ **migrateCases.ts** - Create cases in Convex from Firestore data
  - `createCase(...)` - Migrate a single case with proper field mapping
- ✅ **migrateClients.ts** - Create clients in Convex from Firestore data
  - `createClient(...)` - Migrate a single client with proper field mapping
- ✅ **migrateDocuments.ts** - Create documents in Convex from Firestore data
  - `createDocument(...)` - Migrate a single document with GCS reference

#### Main Orchestrator
- ✅ **migrateUserData.ts** - Main data migration orchestrator
  - `migrateUserData(userId)` - Complete user data migration workflow
  - Handles: cases, clients, documents with file upload and processing
  - Includes: ID mapping, error collection, status tracking

### Implementation Features

#### TypeScript Type Strategy
- ✅ Uses return type annotations (`: Promise<Type>`) instead of `returns` validators
- ✅ Flat interfaces defined in `types.ts` - no deep nesting
- ✅ Avoids TypeScript nesting issues

#### Error Handling
- ✅ Each entity migration wrapped in try-catch
- ✅ Errors collected in flat array of strings
- ✅ Migration continues even if individual items fail
- ✅ Status tracking: pending → in_progress → completed/failed

#### File Migration Workflow
1. ✅ Download from Firebase Storage URL
2. ✅ Upload to GCS with migration prefix
3. ✅ Create document record in Convex
4. ✅ Trigger document processor via HTTP
5. ✅ Document processor updates status asynchronously

#### ID Mapping Strategy
- ✅ Build in-memory maps: Record<oldId, newId>
- ✅ Use for relationship mapping (doc.caseId → new case ID)
- ✅ Skip documents if referenced case not migrated

## 📋 Required Actions Before Running

### 1. Dependencies Installed
✅ Dependencies have been installed:
```bash
cd apps/application
pnpm add @google-cloud/storage node-fetch@2 @types/node-fetch
```

Installed packages:
- `@google-cloud/storage` - Already installed (v7.16.0)
- `node-fetch@2` - Newly installed (v2.7.0)
- `@types/node-fetch` - Newly installed (v2.6.13)

### 2. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Phase 2: Document Processor
DOCUMENT_PROCESSOR_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Note:** All other Phase 1 environment variables should already be configured.

### 3. Schema Updates

✅ No schema changes required - the `migration` field was added in Phase 1.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Test Migration with Single User

```typescript
// From Convex dashboard or your app
const result = await ctx.runAction(
  internal.migrations.migrateUserData,
  { userId: "user_id_here" }
);

console.log("Migration result:", result);
```

### Expected Result Structure

```typescript
{
  success: true,
  userId: "jx7...",
  casesCount: 5,
  clientsCount: 3,
  documentsCount: 12,
  errorCount: 0,
  errors: []
}
```

### Monitoring Migration Progress

Check migration status:
```typescript
const status = await ctx.runQuery(
  internal.migrations.helpers.getMigrationStatus,
  { userId: "user_id_here" }
);
// Returns: { status: "completed", oldKindeId: "...", consentGiven: true }
```

## 📊 Migration Flow

1. **User logs in with Clerk** (Phase 1 complete)
2. **User gives consent** (Phase 3 - to be implemented)
3. **Migration triggered** - `migrateUserData` called
4. **Status set to "in_progress"**
5. **Fetch Firestore data** - cases, clients, documents in parallel
6. **Migrate cases** - build ID mapping
7. **Migrate clients**
8. **Migrate documents** - upload files to GCS, trigger processing
9. **Status set to "completed"**
10. **Return result** with counts and errors

## 🔍 Testing Strategy

### Before Production

1. ✅ **Code Implementation** - All files created and linted
2. ⏭️ **Single User Test** - Test with one user
   ```typescript
   // Find a test user
   const users = await ctx.runQuery(internal.migrations.helpers.getAllUsers, {});
   const testUser = users.find(u => u.email === "test@example.com");
   
   // Run migration
   const result = await ctx.runAction(
     internal.migrations.migrateUserData,
     { userId: testUser._id }
   );
   ```
3. ⏭️ **Verify Results**
   - Check cases created in Convex
   - Verify clients created
   - Confirm documents uploaded to GCS
   - Check document processor received requests
   - Validate processing status updates
4. ⏭️ **Check Error Handling**
   - Test with missing data
   - Test with invalid file URLs
   - Test with orphaned documents (no case)

### Production Monitoring

- Monitor migration status for all users
- Track success rates
- Review error logs
- Validate file uploads to GCS
- Confirm document processing completion

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

### 1. Document Processing Timing
- Document processing is asynchronous
- Processing status updates happen separately
- Check `processingStatus` field on documents table

### 2. File Size Limits
- Maximum file size: 100MB (configurable in constants.ts)
- Timeout for downloads: 30 seconds (configurable)

### 3. Missing Data Handling
- Documents without download URLs are skipped
- Documents with unmigrated cases are skipped
- All errors collected in result.errors array

### 4. Rate Limiting
- No rate limiting currently implemented
- Consider adding delays for large document sets
- GCS has upload limits (check quota)

## 📈 Success Metrics

Migration is successful when:
- ✅ All cases migrated with proper status mapping
- ✅ All clients migrated with correct data
- ✅ All documents uploaded to GCS
- ✅ Document processing triggered for all files
- ✅ Error rate < 5%
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Relationships preserved (doc → case)

## 🎯 Next Steps (Phase 3)

After Phase 2 testing:

1. **Phase 3**: User consent flow
   - Build consent UI component
   - Add consent endpoint
   - Trigger migration on consent
   - Show migration progress to user

2. **Phase 4**: Cleanup
   - Archive old Firestore data
   - Remove Kinde integration
   - Final verification
   - Documentation updates
